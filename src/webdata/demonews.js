        title: 'Juul Leaves Israel',
        date:  'May 28',

<p>
Juul Labs, an American electronic cigarette company, ceases operations in Israel and dismisses 60 employees in Israel.

<p>
The company’s product, which gained immense popularity in the USA, ran into active opposition from the Israel Ministry of Health. In August, 2018 Israel outlawed the import and sale of e-cigarettes made by Silicon Valley startup, citing public health concerns given their nicotine content. The device was banned because it contained nicotine at a concentration higher than 20 milligrams per millilitre and poses “a grave risk to public health.” Following government ban, Juul switched to 1.7% reduced-nicotine pods.

<p>
In November of the same year, the Knesset Labor and Health Commission approved a ban on the production and sale of electronic cigarettes, cartridges and fillers for them with a nicotine concentration of more than 20 mg/ml per container. In addition, electronic cigarettes and related products had to be sold in childproof packaging, which prevented possible damage to the cartridge and leakage of filler. The adoption of an amendment to the law restricted tobacco advertising, which also covered electronic cigarettes.

<p>
In February, 2019 Juul Labs Inc. filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Israel, asking to repeal an amendment to the law restricting tobacco advertising. But a year later, the company decided to withdraw the petition after the court stated that the aforementioned clause would be discussed in May as part of the company’s petition against the full version of the law.

<p>
The constant obstacles in the Israel market made Juul Labs, Inc. decide to leave it.

        title: 'French CBD Ban Contradicts EU Law',
        date:  'May 15',
        text:  `
<p>
The advocate general Evgeni Tanchev at the Court of Justice of the European Union issued an opinion that the restriction was not in line with EU law – an announcement that could require France to overhaul their current restrictions on CBD import and production and prompt legislative reviews and reform in other EU member states.

<p>
France has some of the strictest cannabis and hemp usage laws within the EU, despite being the region’s largest producer of hemp material. In France, CBD products can only be made from the seeds and fibers of the hemp plant – not the flowers or the leaves – so products made with whole hemp plant extract are prohibited, whereas the use of synthetic CBD (chemically identical) is generally permitted.

<p>
In 2014, Kanavape CBD e-cigarette, made from CBD oil imported from the Czech Republic, caused uproar when it was marketed in France. Sébastien Béguerie and Antonin Cohen, Kanavape co-founders, were later convicted of a criminal offense by a Marseille court, on the basis that the CBD oil used in the Kanavape line was a whole plant hemp extract. They appealed their conviction, and now their case has been referred by the French appeals court to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). 

<p>
Tanchev concluded that French legislation restricting hemp imports from another EU member state is in contradiction to the EU laws concerning the free movement of goods. According to the Court of Justice’s advocate general, hemp-derived CBD is not classified as a narcotic drug and is therefore protected by the EU’s free movement principle.

<p>
While Tanchev’s opinion is not legally binding, there is a strong possibility that the CJEU will follow his opinion when it issues a final ruling on the case later this year (expected in September). 

<p>
Eveline Van Keymeulen, who represented ex-Kanavape director Antonin Cohen in the CJEU proceedings, said that "this does not mean that the industry should expect a post-ruling CBD free-for-all in France, but national authorities will need to seek out another way of regulating CBD other than an outright ban... There are a whole range of measures a national government could take to protect human health and public health other than simply prohibiting CBD,” like: limits on concentration, advertising restrictions, labeling provisions, identifying specific sales channels approved for cannabidiol products, etc.
