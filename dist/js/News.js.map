In August, 2018 Israel outlawed the import and sale of e-cigarettes made by Silicon Valley startup, citing public health concerns given their nicotine content. The device was banned because it contained nicotine at a concentration higher than 20 milligrams per millilitre and poses “a grave risk to public health.” Following government ban, Juul switched to 1.7% reduced-nicotine pods.\n\n<p>\nIn November of the same year, the Knesset Labor and Health Commission approved a ban on the production and sale of electronic cigarettes, cartridges and fillers for them with a nicotine concentration of more than 20 mg/ml per container. In addition, electronic cigarettes and related products had to be sold in childproof packaging, which prevented possible damage to the cartridge and leakage of filler. The adoption of an amendment to the law restricted tobacco advertising, which also covered electronic cigarettes.\n\n<p>\nIn February, 2019 Juul Labs Inc. filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Israel, asking to repeal an amendment to the law restricting tobacco advertising. But a year later, the company decided to withdraw the petition after the court stated that the aforementioned clause would be discussed in May as part of the company’s petition against the full version of the law.\n\n<p>\nThe constant obstacles in the Israel market made Juul Labs, Inc. decide to leave it.\n`\n    },\n    {\n        title: 'PMI Presented a Novel Reduced Risk Prototype Product',\n        date:  'May 24',\n        text:  `\n<p>\nPhilip Morris International offered a new alternative nicotine-based electronic-free product, Platform 3, based on acquired technology that uses a chemical process to create a nicotine-containing vapor.\n\n<p>\nPlatform 3 is a novel product called to provide nicotine delivery and satisfaction similar to combustible cigarettes. The device is composed of two parts: a consumable that contains highly-soluble encapsulated nicotine powder, and a non-electronic device that activates it. The consumable contains organic acid and nicotine in separate sections. Once it is inserted into the mechanical device, the nicotine powder is aerosolized and inhaled solely through the power of breath.\n\n<p>\nThe 1-month clinical safety study of Platform 3 was successfully completed in 2020.\n\n`\n    },\n    {\n        title: 'Puff Inc.

Plaintiffs are represented by the law firm of Gallinger Law PC and expect $50 million in restitutionary and $25 million in punitive damages.\n\n<p>\nThe list of defendants includes international and US distributors, e-commerce companies, and brick and mortar retail stores: CACUQ USA INC. (CA); CACUQ USA INC. (NY); CACUQ USA INC. (TX); CACUQ WHOLESALE, INC.; Shenzhen VapeMons Technology Co., Ltd; Blink Imports LLC; J&L D Sunset Wholesale & Tobacco; Smoke 1 (CA); Daniel Rahbar Distributions and Representations LLC; Gypsy Vapes a.k.a.

Defendants are believed to be only a small number of the violators, as the anti-counterfeit verification system at puffbar.com has identified thousands of retail stores at which consumers bought devices which failed the check.\n`\n    },\n    {\n        title: 'French CBD Ban Contradicts EU Law',\n        date:  'May 15',\n        text:  `\n<p>\nThe advocate general Evgeni Tanchev at the Court of Justice of the European Union issued an opinion that the restriction was not in line with EU law – an announcement that could require France to overhaul their current restrictions on CBD import and production and prompt legislative reviews and reform in other EU member states.\n\n<p>\nFrance has some of the strictest cannabis and hemp usage laws within the EU, despite being the region’s largest producer of hemp material. In France, CBD products can only be made from the seeds and fibers of the hemp plant – not the flowers or the leaves – so products made with whole hemp plant extract are prohibited, whereas the use of synthetic CBD (chemically identical) is generally permitted.\n\n<p>\nIn 2014, Kanavape CBD e-cigarette, made from CBD oil imported from the Czech Republic, caused uproar when it was marketed in France. Sébastien Béguerie and Antonin Cohen, Kanavape co-founders, were later convicted of a criminal offense by a Marseille court, on the basis that the CBD oil used in the Kanavape line was a whole plant hemp extract. They appealed their conviction, and now their case has been referred by the French appeals court to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). \n\n<p>\nTanchev concluded that French legislation restricting hemp imports from another EU member state is in contradiction to the EU laws concerning the free movement of goods. According to the Court of Justice’s advocate general, hemp-derived CBD is not classified as a narcotic drug and is therefore protected by the EU’s free movement principle.\n\n<p>\nWhile Tanchev’s opinion is not legally binding, there is a strong possibility that the CJEU will follow his opinion when it issues a final ruling on the case later this year (expected in September). \n\n<p>\nEveline Van Keymeulen, who represented ex-Kanavape director Antonin Cohen in the CJEU proceedings, said that \"this does not mean that the industry should expect a post-ruling CBD free-for-all in France, but national authorities will need to seek out another way of regulating CBD other than an outright ban... There are a whole range of measures a national government could take to protect human health and public health other than simply prohibiting CBD,” like: limits on concentration, advertising restrictions, labeling provisions, identifying specific sales channels approved for cannabidiol products, etc.\n`\n    },\n    {\n        title: 'Omura Secured $5 Million in Funding',\n        date:  'Apr 27',\n        text:  `\n<p>\nOmura, a next generation heat-not-burn platform for the clean and effective consumption of whole flower cannabis and hemp CBD, announced it raised a further funding round which brought the total to $5m.\n\n<p>\nCalifornia-based vaporizer company informed that former Canopy Growth Corporation CEO and Founder, Bruce Linton, has participated in its latest fundraising round as well as joined as strategic advisor. Mike Simpson, the company’s CEO, underlined that Omura have benefited from Bruce Linton's counsel and expertise. This will undoubtedly strengthen company's position as a new global platform for the consumption of cannabis and CBD hemp.\n\n<p>\nThe company intends to use the funds for expansion and technology growth. In January of this year, Omura began retailing with six premium flower brands in California, and will be expanding across recreational and medical States in the US as well as Canada over the course of 2020. The brand is also partnered with Greenlane Distribution for national distribution in the United States.\n`\n    },\n]\nexport default NewsList\n","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('v-container',[_c('el-head-some',{attrs:{\"caption\":\"News\"}}),_c('v-divider'),_vm._l((_vm.NewsList),function(news){return [_c('article',{staticClass:\"pa-8\"},[_c('header',{staticClass:\"display-1\"},[_vm._v(_vm._s(news.title))]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"subtitle\"},[_vm._v(_vm._s(news.date))]),_c('section',{staticClass:\"body-1\",domProps:{\"innerHTML\":_vm._s(news.text)}})])]})],2)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","<template>\n<v-container>\n\n    <el-head-some\n        caption=\"News\"\n        />\n\n    <v-divider/>\n\n    <template v-for=\"news in NewsList\">\n\n        <article class=\"pa-8\">\n            <header class=\"display-1\">{{news.title}}</header>\n            <p class=\"subtitle\">{{news.date}}</p>\n            <section class=\"body-1\" v-html=\"news.text\"/>\n        </article>\n\n    </template>\n\n\n</v-container>\n</template>\n<script>\n\n///*/// ---------------------------- export seed\n\n    let props       = []\n    let components  = {}\n    let methods     = {}\n    let computed    = {}\n    let watch       = {}\n    let data        = {}\n\n\n    data = {\n        msg:'',\n    ...data }\n\n    import elHeadSome from '@/components/el-head-some.vue'\n    components = { elHeadSome, ...components }\n\n    import NewsList from '@/webdata/demonews.js'\n    data = {\n        NewsList,\n    ...data }\n\n///*/// ---------------------------- export ready\n\nexport default {\n\n    name: 'News',\n    props,\n    components,\n    methods,\n    computed,\n    watch,\n    data () { return data },\n\n// --------------------------------- mounted\n\n    mounted () {\n        \n    },\n\n// ---------------------------------\n\n}\n\n///*/// ---------------------------- END\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/vuetify-loader/lib/loader.js??ref--17-0!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./News.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/vuetify-loader/lib/loader.js??ref--17-0!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./News.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./News.vue?vue&type=template&id=a5111634&\"\nimport script from \"./News.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./News.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports\n\n/* vuetify-loader */\nimport installComponents from \"!../../node_modules/vuetify-loader/lib/runtime/installComponents.js\"\nimport { VContainer } from 'vuetify/lib/components/VGrid';\nimport { VDivider } from 'vuetify/lib/components/VDivider';\ninstallComponents(component, {VContainer,VDivider})\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
